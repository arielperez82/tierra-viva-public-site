# Tierra Viva Public Website — Roadmap

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Use:** High-level themes and revisit items; detailed work lives in [backlog.md](backlog.md).

---

## Content infrastructure

- **Pillars as content collection** — Revisit the four pillars (Why + Model) and manage them as markdown via an Astro content collection instead of `src/data/pillars.ts`. Enables markdown-based editing and aligns with the Research collection pattern. **Backlog:** [TV-6.5 — Revisit PILLARS as content collection (markdown)](backlog.md#tv-65--revisit-pillars-as-content-collection-markdown).

---

## Phases (summary)

Execution order and ticket counts are in [backlog.md](backlog.md). Phases 0–2 (quality gate, scaffold, single-page) are in progress or done; Phases 3–6 (core pages, projects, research, polish + content collection) follow.
