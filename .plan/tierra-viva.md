# **OVERVIEW**

Tierra Viva Investments is a real estate investment platform focused on creating high-quality, purpose-driven communities across Latin America. Tierra Viva unlocks the next chapter of Latin America's growth by channeling global capital into high-yield, purpose-driven assets where housing, education, and community converge to serve the region's rising affluent class.

We are backed by a network of global and diaspora investors, family offices, and strategic partners who share our belief that the future of real estate in Latin America lies in integrated, sustainable, and community-centered development. Our first fund will be focused on the Dominican Republic, the fastest growing market in Latin America.

### **Thesis**

**Our mission is to unlock the potential of Latin America's most promising places by connecting global capital with local vision.**

**Latin America is entering a new cycle of growth — driven by urban expansion, educational mobility, and the rising demand for qualityof-life assets. Tierra Viva invests at the intersection of these trends, targeting opportunities that combine:**

### **Market overview**

Dominican Republic — among the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, with a vibrant diaspora, expanding affluent class, and increasing investor confidence.

Unprecedented growth in last 20 years at ~5% annually, but the market offers few options for Dominican families that need safe, high-quality communities with access to world-class education.

11 million population with additional 3 million in diaspora with \$100 billion of wealth, deep connections with the island sending over \$10 billion in remittances annually.

Foreign direct investment hit a record \$4.5 billion in 2024, including \$798 million in real estate, while 1H-2025 FDI reached 2.89 billion (+15% YoY) keeping momentum intact.

DR is poised to attract additional foreign investment amid U.S. tariff shifts and nearshoring trends, adding to the over US \$8 billion in exports to the U.S. driven by its free trade zones and investor-friendly tax regime.

### **Rising affluent-class driving demand for housing and services**

Housing shortage of over 1.4 million units, growing by 60,000 annually, and driving market appreciation of ~10% YoY

Schools with an International Baccalaureate certification offer 23 seats/million compared to 385 seats/million in the US, signalling a scarce premium-education supply where new capacity can capture persistent, price-insensitive demand.

Retail gross leasable area (GLA) stands at ~0.5 sq ft per capita, compared to ~24 sq ft per capita in the US which represents an 80x undersupply at the quality end

### **Fund Structure**

The fund will serve as a holding company in the US, while projects are structured through SPVs set up in the Dominican Republic with clear capital stacks and USD-based protections, offering transparency, control, and repatriation efficiency for investors.

Fund I has a target of \$30 million, to be invested in an Integrated community (residential, commercial, recreational) anchored around an International Baccalaureate (IB) accredited school.

Strategic perimeter zone of expanding area within Santiago with 250K sqm site identified. Site is directly connected to the northern bypass, located 5 minutes from the city's major free trade zone, 15 minutes from the airport, well connected to urban arteries, and access to coastal areas and key ports.

- Aim to build 150 units (luxury townhouses and apartments) with sales price ranging from \$600K-\$1.2M, differentiated by modular construction, luxury amenities, mixed commercial and retail space, green spaces, and self-reliant and sustainable energy and utilities.
- Local lead developer with track record already established, with additional developers ready for a competitive bidding process coupled with performance-based agreements to derisk cost overruns and delays.
- Partnering with innovative school networks such as Alpha Schools and Acton Academy to develop a franchise model, coupled with IB certification to offer a world class, bilingual international school. Starting with pre-K-grade 1 with additional grades added annually and aiming to have 350 K-12 students by year 10, with average tuition reaching over \$15K/student annually.

### **Target hold of 10 years with option to draw down starting in year 5.**

- Aiming to have 6-8 anchor LPs in early rounds, with smaller LPs with minimum \$250K ticket to come in later rounds.
- GP commitment of 5% at \$1.5M with 2% fee and 20% carry, along with an experienced Investment Committee and Fund Administrator, ensuring SOC-audited reporting.

### **Round 1**

close in 8-12 months with \$10 million to launch fund, establish GP and complete land acquisition.

### **Round 2** close in 12-18 months with \$10 million to complete phase 1 with initial units and school facilities.

### **Round 3**

close in 18-24 months with \$10 million to complete phases 2 & 3 which includes mixed commercial and retail spaces.

• Exploring the tokenization of investor pools along with home buyers to reduce friction, capture efficiency gains, and allow for easier liquidity for private market transactions.

### **Expected returns**

- The \$30M fund is expected to have a 26% IRR with a 4X+ MOIC over 10 years.
- Option to draw down by year 5 with X IRR and a X MOIC.
- Additional \$7 million in debt will be raised to provide short term construction financing.

### **Fund Differentiation**

**Diaspora demand flywheel** 

convert hard-currency remittances and expat/HNW networks into USD-linked presales and leases, creating early cash flow and faster DPI.

**Education-anchored scarcity (with a Global Partner)** 

pair premium housing with a branded international-school or learning hub to unlock price premiums, deepen community stickiness, and drive outsized absorption.

### **Institutionalized capital architecture**

SPV-per-asset with clear capital stacks, USD protections, hedging policy, phase-gated draws, GMP/fixed-price contracts, and best in class fund administration for clean repatriation and governance.

**Established local partners, proprietary access** 

long-standing Santiago relationships secure offmarket land and expedited permits, reducing execution risk and delivering belowmarket basis.

# **Appendix**

### **FAQs**

1.How do you protect pricing?

Small releases (12–20 homes), no headline discounts, and upgrades/closing support instead. Next release only after the last one is mostly sold. 2.When do you break ground? Only after a presale gate (≥35% signed contracts). That lowers financing risk and protects margins. 3.What if construction costs move up? We use fixed-price/GMP (guaranteed max pricing) where feasible, hold a separate hard-cost contingency, and lock key materials early. Monthly variance tracking catches creep fast. 4.What if sales slow? We pause new releases, preserve price, and switch marketing to corporate blocks and diaspora campaigns. No fire sales. 5.How do buyers pay? USD contracts with milestone payment plans. Funds sit in fideicomiso trusts until conditions are met. Financing partners in both DR and US offering up to 80% LTV 6.Will utilities keep up with growth? Yes—capacity letters from water/sewer and power providers are secured before Notice-to-Proceed, and the site includes backup power for resilience. 7.How do you handle permits and approvals? We file through the national single window (VUC) and move in sequence: land/title → land-use (city) → environment → construction license → start permit. 8.What keeps the schedule on track? Tier-1 local partners with experienced track records, monthly build-to-plan reports, and tight change-order rules. 9.What if we slip on timing? We re-baseline the schedule, use float in non-critical areas, and protect cash by staggering draws and releases. No new phase starts until gates are hit. 10.How safe and resilient is the site? Single-entry access, patrols, and CPTED lighting. Buildings use wind-rated glazing, shading, insulation, and a solar-ready microgrid with backup. 11.What supports rental or resale values? Scarce premium supply, a school anchor, daily amenities, and airport/FTZ access. These raise retention, rental yields, and exit liquidity. 12.How do investors get their money back sooner (DPI)? USD-linked presales on homes, early lease-up of retail, and an option to forward-sell stabilized retail pads around Years 5–6. 13.What reporting will LPs see? Quarterly financials and a live dashboard with leads→contracts→cash, cost vs. budget, schedule, and DPI outlook. Independent admin and annual audit. 14.How is FX risk managed? Home and retail contracts are USD-linked. Local costs are hedged where needed; covenants and cash buffers cover swings. 15.Who are your sales partners? Murcia Group (Cibao/North Coast), Urban Group (national + diaspora), and Ziel Group (Santiago micromarkets). They bring buyers; we enforce brand and pricing discipline. 16.How do you choose developers and contractors?

Track record, balance sheet, fixed-price capacity, QA/QC culture, and delivery history. Performance-based contracts with clear remedies.

17.What's the exit plan for homes and holds?

Sell-down the homes in phases; hold and stabilize the retail and school; consider a partial recap or forward sale once NOI is seasoned.

What's the single biggest risk—and your backstop?

Sales velocity. Backstops: small releases, presale gates, strong broker network, corporate seat deals, and the school as a durable demand engine.

### **Potential Sites**

## **Marketing Strategy**

#### **Phase 1 Residential Go-to-Market (30-40 Homes) Goal (First 6-9 Months)**

- Reach ≥35% signed contracts before construction starts
- Lift prices 2-3% each small release

### **Product & Pricing Strategy**

- Family-first homes: 3-4BR townhomes + large apartments with storage, home office, two parking spots
- Zero-commute life: on-site international school, wellness club, clinic, café, pharmacy
- USD pricing in small batches of 12-20 homes to protect value
- Use upgrade credits/closing help, not headline discounts
- Next batch launches only after prior one mostly sold

#### **Delivery Confidence**

- Constructora Espejo (lead developer), Estrella (siteworks/structures), GRM Ingenieros (buildings/amenities)
- Monthly build updates with photos, drone footage, timeline vs. plan

#### **Target Segments & Execution**

- **HNW Dominicans (Santiago/SDQ)**: Ziel Group, private-bank events, family-office briefings; hooks include convenient location, school, security, parking
- **Dominican Diaspora (NY/NJ/FL/MA)**: Urban Group, bilingual webinars, bank/fintech partners, WhatsApp concierge; USD contracts with fideicomiso trusts, "fly-and-buy" weekends, priority school seats
- **Expats & FTZ Executives**: Murcia Group, company HR/relocation partners; 15 min to airport, 5 min to free-trade zones, move-in packages, lease-to-own option
