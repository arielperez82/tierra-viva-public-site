## Round 1: Initial Analysis

### Senior PM
The wireframe is **lean and regulatory-safe**: eight nav items, clear disclaimer, no fund terms on the public site. That’s correct for a first-time fund—you don’t want to imply an offer. Gaps: (1) **Stakeholder clarity**—the site serves both *investors* (LPs, family offices) and *partners* (developers, school operators, brokers). The wireframe doesn’t segment these; one journey can dilute the other. (2) **Projects & Focus** is vague; competitive research shows PropTech/PE sites use concrete “portfolio” or “projects” with asset-level detail. (3) **Primary CTA**—“Start an Introductory Conversation”—is good for high-touch; we need a second path for “just learning” that doesn’t feel like commitment. Recommendation: keep the eight-top structure but **name and scope each nav item** so Agree/Perform are clear (e.g., who owns “Strategy” content, what “Platform” means vs. “Strategy”).

### SEO Strategist
The wireframe is **narrative-heavy and section-rich**, which helps topical authority. Risks: (1) **Flat, modular architecture** (per competitive research) favors fewer, deeper pages with clear H1/H2 and answer-style content. Eight top-level items may fragment signals unless each page is a clear “pillar” (e.g., Strategy = thesis + approach; Platform = how we build). (2) **AEO**: 2025–2026 trend is content that answers specific queries (e.g., “education-anchored real estate Latin America,” “regenerative development Dominican Republic”). Homepage sections should be structured so key sentences can be extracted as direct answers. (3) **Research & Insights** is a strong SEO asset—featured insights in the wireframe (“Why Education Anchors Long-Term Community Value,” “Dominican Republic: Demographics…”) are exactly the kind of long-form, keyword-aligned content that ranks and feeds AI answer engines. Recommendation: **keep the sitemap** but define one primary keyword intent per page and ensure each has a clear “answer block” near the top. Consider merging or subordinating **Projects & Focus** under **Platform** or **Strategy** to avoid thin or duplicate content.

### Product Manager
The **offer** in tierra-viva.md is clear: $30M fund, DR flagship, education-anchored community, 26% IRR / 4x+ MOIC. The wireframe **does not** sell the offer on the homepage; it sells *purpose* and *model*. That’s a product choice: public site = trust and narrative; deal terms = behind “Start a Conversation.” So the “product” of the website is **credibility + lead quality**, not deal closure. From that lens: (1) **Strategy** and **Platform** in the nav might overlap in a user’s mind (“how you invest” vs. “how you build”). I’d treat **Strategy** = capital/thesis/fund approach, **Platform** = development model, execution, first project. (2) **Projects & Focus** could be the first concrete asset (e.g., Altos de Gurabo) with high-level specs—no financials—to show “we’re real.” (3) Missing from wireframe: **explicit audience switcher** (Investors / Partners / Press or similar). Even a light touch (e.g., “For investors” vs. “For partners” in CTAs or footer) would improve fit. Recommendation: **refine nav labels** and add a **single “Project” or “Where We Build”** page that showcases the flagship without crossing into offering territory.

### Content Creator
The **voice** in the wireframe is consistent: aspirational but grounded, “living capital,” “regenerative,” “stewardship.” That fits the fund doc and differentiates from pure financial PE. Tensions: (1) Homepage is long—eight sections. Benchmarks (Fifth Wall, Camber Creek) use hero + proof + clear next step; we risk scroll fatigue. I’d compress **Why Tierra Viva** and **Four Pillars** into a tighter “Our Model” block and move some depth to **Strategy** or **Platform**. (2) **Responsible Investment** as its own nav item is a strength (ESG integrated, not buried); keep it. (3) **Partner With Us** at the end is good; the two CTAs (“Introductory Conversation” and “Partnership Opportunities”) could be differentiated by audience (investors vs. operators/partners) so copy doesn’t blur. (4) **Research & Insights** teaser on homepage is strong—those three featured pieces should be real, substantive articles that support SEO and conviction. Recommendation: **shorten homepage scroll** by collapsing or linking out to dedicated pages for pillars/geography/team; keep hero, model summary, one proof block, and CTA. Strengthen **Research** as the main “content product” for credibility.

### UX Researcher
From a **journey** perspective: (1) **Investor** path: Land → understand thesis → see team/governance → see responsible approach → trust → contact. (2) **Partner** path: Land → see what you build / where → see team and partners → contact. The wireframe supports both but doesn’t signpost. A single scroll-down homepage forces everyone through the same sequence; some investors may want “Strategy” and “Team” fast, while partners may want “Projects” and “Platform.” Recommendation: **keep one homepage** but add a **small audience cue** (e.g., “Investors” / “Partners” links or a one-line “Whether you’re an investor or a development partner…”). Nav order could reflect priority: About → Strategy → Platform → Projects & Focus → Responsible Investment → Team → Research → Contact. (3) **Footer** utility (Purpose & Disclaimer, Responsible Investment, Privacy, Jurisdiction) is correct; ensure disclaimer is visible without being alarming. (4) **Team & Governance**: wireframe only highlights Ramon; fund doc has full GP + IC + partners. Team page should list all with roles and short bios—critical for trust.

### Brainstormer
What if we **didn’t** follow the wireframe? Alternatives: (A) **Single-page scroll** with anchor nav (like many modern PE/VC sites)—all eight “sections” as sections, no separate Strategy/Platform pages. Pros: simple, fast to build, strong narrative flow. Cons: SEO weaker per page, long scroll. (B) **Hub-and-spoke**: Home = hero + three paths (Investors / Partners / Research). Each path leads to a tailored sub-site. Pros: clear segmentation. Cons: more content to maintain, risk of thin pages. (C) **Wireframe-plus**: Keep the wireframe but add **one** bold move—e.g., “First Project” as a dedicated mini-site (Altos de Gurabo) with masterplan, school, sustainability, no numbers. Positions Tierra Viva as “we’re already building” not “we’re raising.” I’d lean **C**: the wireframe is 80% right; the missing 20% is **concrete proof**—one project, one place, one story. That also aligns with competitive research: “Portfolio Stories” and “asset cards” build trust. So: **evolve the wireframe**, don’t replace it. Add a clear **Project** experience and sharpen audience cues.

## Round 2: Cross-Examination

### Senior PM responds to SEO Strategist
I agree that eight nav items can fragment SEO if pages are thin. Your idea of one primary intent per page and “answer blocks” fits our need for clarity. I’d add: **Agree** on pillar ownership (e.g., Marketing/Content owns Research; Leadership owns Team and Strategy narrative) so we don’t end up with duplicate “thesis” content on Strategy and Platform. Merging **Projects & Focus** under **Platform** could work if “Platform” becomes “How We Build & Where”—first project as proof of platform.

### SEO Strategist responds to Product Manager
Treating **Strategy** = capital/thesis and **Platform** = execution + first project gives us a clean keyword split: Strategy page targets “real estate fund Latin America,” “education-anchored investment”; Platform/Project page targets “sustainable community Dominican Republic,” “Santiago development.” That supports both investor and partner queries without cannibalization.

### Product Manager responds to Content Creator
Compressing the homepage is a product win: fewer sections means clearer “next step.” I’d keep hero, one “Why + Model” block (combined), one “Where we’re focused” (geography + first project teaser), one “Value & Governance” (strategy + responsible investment snapshot), team teaser, Research teaser, CTA. That’s six sections instead of eight and pushes depth to dedicated pages.

### Content Creator responds to UX Researcher
The audience cue (“Investors” / “Partners”) doesn’t have to be a full switcher—could be two CTAs in the final section: “For Investors: Start a Conversation” and “For Partners: Explore Opportunities.” Same page, different next step. That keeps one journey but branches at conversion.

### UX Researcher responds to Brainstormer
Option C (wireframe-plus with one project) matches what I said: “Projects & Focus” should be concrete. Making it a **first project** page (Altos de Gurabo) with place, school, sustainability, connectivity—no financials—gives both investors and partners something tangible. Nav could be “Projects & Focus” with one featured project, expandable later.

### Brainstormer responds to Senior PM
The “who owns what” (RAPID) point is important. If we add a **Project** page, Perform = whoever has the masterplan and narrative (likely GP + ops). Recommend = this panel; Agree = Tierra Viva leadership; Input = content/SEO. That way the proposal is implementable.

---

## Round 3: Convergence

- **Nav**: Keep eight items but **rename/clarify** so Strategy = thesis/capital, Platform = development model + execution. **Projects & Focus** = one (or more) concrete projects, starting with flagship; content is place, school, sustainability, connectivity—no offer details.
- **Homepage**: **Shorten** to hero, combined Why + Model, geography + project teaser, value/governance snapshot, team teaser, Research teaser, CTA block with **two audience-specific CTAs** (investors vs. partners).
- **SEO**: One primary intent per page; answer-style blocks for AEO; **Research & Insights** as main content engine with real, keyword-aligned articles.
- **Trust**: Team page with full GP + IC + key partners; Responsible Investment as top-level nav; footer disclaimer and legal links as in wireframe.
- **Differentiation**: One **featured project** (Altos de Gurabo) as proof—“we’re building”—without crossing into offering. Optional: hero video or asset-led imagery per competitive research.

---

## Final Synthesis: Recommendation

**Path chosen: Refine the wireframe (adjustments), not a full redesign.**

**Why:**

1. **Regulatory and risk**: The wireframe already respects “informational only,” no solicitation, disclaimer in footer. A completely new structure would require re-checking every path for compliance. Refining keeps the safe baseline.

2. **Competitive fit**: The competitive research says leading PE/PropTech sites use flat, modular structure, hero + proof, team, thought leadership. The wireframe already has those; it’s missing **concrete asset/project** and **sharper audience branching**. Adding one project page and clearer CTAs gets us there without copying a different paradigm.

3. **Stakeholder alignment**: The team “thinks” the current structure makes sense. Changing the sitemap drastically (e.g., hub-and-spoke or single-page only) would need strong justification. Panel consensus: the sitemap is *right in spirit*; it needs **clarification of labels**, **one strong project page**, **tighter homepage**, and **audience-aware CTAs**.

4. **Implementation**: Refinements are scoped to content and structure, not a new IA. Easier to agree (Tierra Viva), perform (content/design), and iterate.
