## **SECTION 1 — WHY TIERRA VIVA EXISTS (Purpose)**

**Section header:**  
 **Why Tierra Viva**

**Copy:**  
 Across the Caribbean and Latin America, families who once left in search of opportunity are increasingly looking to return—seeking places that offer both prosperity and belonging.

Tierra Viva exists to make that return possible.

We design communities where children can learn, families can grow, and capital is deployed with intention. Our approach reframes development as a transformational ecosystem—where education unlocks potential, enterprise fuels progress, and shared prosperity becomes the measure of success.

## **SECTION 2 — WHAT WE BUILD (The Model)**

**Section header:**  
 **An Education-Anchored Development Model**

**Intro sentence:**  
 Every Tierra Viva community is designed as an interconnected system of social, economic, and environmental value creation—anchored by learning and governed for the long term.

### **Four Pillars (visual tiles)**

**Learning as the Catalyst**  
 A high-quality school with an international curriculum anchors each community—attracting families, cultivating talent, and supporting long-term social mobility.

**Homes that Regenerate Place**  
 Thoughtfully designed residences aligned with global sustainability standards, resilient infrastructure, and long-term stewardship of land and resources.

**Enterprise that Multiplies Opportunity**  
 Mixed-use and commercial spaces that support entrepreneurship, local businesses, and returning diaspora professionals.

**Stewardship for the Long Term**  
 Transparent governance, local hiring pathways, and regenerative land management practices that strengthen communities and protect value over time.

## **SECTION 3 — WHERE WE ARE FOCUSED (Geography & Timing)**

**Section header:**  
 **Focused Where Long-Term Fundamentals Align**

**Copy:**  
 Tierra Viva is currently exploring its first flagship concept in the Dominican Republic—one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, supported by a vibrant diaspora, an expanding professional class, and strong long-term demographic and economic fundamentals.

Shifting demographics, rising professional demand, and a structural undersupply of education-anchored communities create a unique window for integrated, long-term development.

**Preliminary planning envisions a thoughtfully phased, mixed-use community including:**

- Approximately 150–200 residential units

- A high-quality international-curriculum school

- Community amenities, green corridors, and mixed commercial space

- Sustainable infrastructure systems designed for resilience and efficiency

## **SECTION 5 — RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT**

**Section header:**  
 **Responsible Investment as a Source of Resilience**

**Intro sentence:**  
 For Tierra Viva, responsible investment is not a separate objective—it is integral to how long-term value is protected and compounded.

**Copy:**  
 We approach responsibility through a pragmatic, governance-led lens, focusing on the factors most material to durable real-asset performance in emerging markets.

Our approach emphasizes:

- **Governance & Transparency:** Clear oversight structures, disciplined capital allocation, and transparent reporting aligned with international best practices.

- **Environmental Resilience:** Infrastructure, energy, and water systems designed to reduce operating risk, enhance efficiency, and support long-term asset durability.

- **Social Foundations:** Education access, local employment pathways, and community integration that strengthen demand stability and long-term occupancy.

- **Stewardship Orientation:** Development decisions evaluated not only on near-term returns, but on their ability to sustain value across economic cycles.

We intend to report on selected, material indicators over time as projects advance, with a focus on substance over signaling.
