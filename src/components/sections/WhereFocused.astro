      Where We're Focused
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-6 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-forest-dark/95 sm:text-lg">
      We are focused first in the Dominican Republic—one of the fastest-growing
      economies in Latin America, with a vibrant diaspora, an expanding
      professional class, and strong long-term demographic and economic
      fundamentals.

    <p class="mt-6 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-forest-dark/95 sm:text-lg">
      Altos de Gurabo is our first flagship community in Santiago—an integrated
      neighborhood anchored by an international school, with homes, green
      space, and daily conveniences in one place.
