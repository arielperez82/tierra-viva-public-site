      Why Tierra Viva
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      We build education-anchored, regenerative communities where learning and
      long-term stewardship create lasting value.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-center text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Across the Caribbean and Latin America, families who once left in search of
      opportunity are increasingly looking to return—seeking places that offer
      both prosperity and belonging. Tierra Viva exists to make that return
      possible.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      We design communities where children can learn, families can grow, and
      capital is deployed with intention. Our approach reframes development as a
      transformational ecosystem—where education unlocks potential, enterprise
      fuels progress, and shared prosperity becomes the measure of success.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Every Tierra Viva community is designed as an interconnected system of
      social, economic, and environmental value creation—anchored by learning
      and governed for the long term.
