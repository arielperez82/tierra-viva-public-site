High-quality schools with international curricula anchor communities by attracting families, cultivating talent, and supporting long-term social mobility. For real estate development in emerging markets, education is not only a social good—it is a structural driver of demand stability, absorption, and value retention.

## Demand and stickiness

Families that choose a community for its school tend to stay. Relocation costs, enrollment continuity, and peer networks create switching costs that support occupancy and resale liquidity. In markets where premium education supply is scarce, a strong school can command a persistent price premium and reduce sensitivity to economic cycles.

## Alignment with institutional capital

Education-anchored projects align with the priorities of impact-oriented and institutional capital: measurable social outcomes, governance, and long-term horizons. This alignment can broaden the investor base and support patient capital structures that suit phased, community-led development.

## How we use this
