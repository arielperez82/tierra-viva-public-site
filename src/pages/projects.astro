    <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Altos de Gurabo is Tierra Viva's first flagship community in Santiago,
      Dominican Republic—an integrated neighborhood anchored by an
      international school, with homes, green space, and daily conveniences in
      one place.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Location</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Altos de Gurabo is in Santiago (Gurabo), the country's second-largest
      city and industrial heartbeat. Santiago is one of the fastest-growing
      economies in Latin America, with a vibrant diaspora, expanding
      professional class, and strong long-term fundamentals.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
      Integrated Community
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      The community is designed as a mixed-use, walkable environment combining
      residential, educational, commercial, and recreational uses. A
      world-class international school anchors the neighborhood—attracting
      families and supporting long-term social mobility. We are exploring
      partnerships with innovative school networks to offer a bilingual,
      international curriculum; no financial or unit details are disclosed on
      this site.

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
      Residential Options
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      The master plan includes thoughtfully designed townhomes and apartments
      aligned with global sustainability standards and resilient infrastructure.
      Residential formats are phased to support community building and
      long-term stewardship.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Connectivity</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      The site is connected to the Northern Bypass and upgraded roadways,
      with strong access to the city's free-trade zones (minutes away) and
      Cibao International Airport (approximately 15 minutes). This connectivity
      supports zero-commute living for residents and aligns with nearshoring
      and professional demand in the region.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Amenities</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Planned amenities include wellness facilities, parks, green corridors,
      and security designed for family living. Mixed commercial space will
      provide daily essentials on-site, reducing reliance on long commutes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Sustainability</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Infrastructure is designed for energy and water efficiency, with
      climate-adapted building envelopes and resilient systems. Native,
      drought-tolerant planting and regenerative land management support
      long-term environmental stewardship.
