      Investment Thesis and Strategy
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Tierra Viva invests in education-anchored real estate across Latin
      America. We focus where urban expansion, educational mobility, and
      rising demand for quality-of-life assets converge—targeting opportunities
      that combine strong fundamentals with purpose-driven development.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Thesis</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      Our strategy centers on early entry into undervalued perimeter zones and
      phased community development. We target expanding urban areas, acquire
      land ahead of market inflection, and create value at both the horizontal
      (land) and vertical (build) stages.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Execution</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-tierra-graphite/90">
      We partner with best-in-class local operating teams for speed and cost
      control. Development is phased and community-led: infrastructure and
      amenities first, followed by early presales to upwardly mobile families,
      then schools and commercial nodes. A long-term capital structure enables
      prudent timing and alignment with generational goals.
